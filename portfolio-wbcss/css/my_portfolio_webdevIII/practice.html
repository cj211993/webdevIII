                    <p>A fishery (plural: fisheries) is an organized effort by humans to catch fish or other aquatic species, an activity known as fishing.

                        Generally, a fishery exists for the purpose of providing human food, although other aims are possible (such as sport or recreational fishing), or obtaining ornamental fish or fish products such as fish oil.
                        
                        Regardless of purpose, however, the term fishery generally refers to a fishing effort centered on either a particular ecoregion or a particular species or type of fish or aquatic animal, and usually fisheries are differentiated by both criteria.
                        
                        Examples would be the salmon fishery of Alaska, the cod fishery off the Lofoten islands or the tuna fishery of the Eastern Pacific.
                        
                        Most fisheries are marine, rather than freshwater; most marine fisheries are based near the coast.
                        
                        This is not only because harvesting from relatively shallow waters is easier than in the open ocean, but also because fish are much more abundant near the coastal shelf, due to coastal upwelling and the abundance of nutrients available there.</p>
